% Writes don't trigger MCE. Only consumed poison / media errors trigger MCE.
% I.e. even a read-modify-write operation to write-back a partially dirty
% cacheline will not trigger an MCE because the read is not consumed by the core
% only the cache. We'll get notified when that happens, but only by CMCI
