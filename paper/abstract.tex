As almost all cloud applications run in the virtual environment and many IT infrastructures run in the cloud or on-premise virtualization environment, it is important to understand key aspects of virtualization.
%
While many virtualization environments have been proposed and are in use, traditional VMs are too heavyweight and do not scale well.
%
On the other hand, containers that are on the other end of the scale is lightweight but do not provide good isolation, hence potentially not as secure.
%
The aim of the work is to provide a variety of performance measurements of benchmarks on the different types of virtualization in the spectrum: traditional VM, light weight VM, and containers.
%
We use \emph{gVisor} as a base for our benchmarking, and the XXXX
%
Then for a real life benchmarks we \emph{run convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow} and \emph{mySQL}, and the XXX.
